 * To adjust the settings according to your prefered theme (Preferences > Appearance), font size (Editor > Font Size), and keyboard shortcuts (Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts).

3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
* Activity Bar: Located on the left, it provides access to common actions like opening files, searching, and debugging.
 * Side Bar: Displays the File Explorer (for managing files and folders) and Source Control (for version control with Git).
 * Editor Group: The central area where you write and edit your code.
 * Status Bar: Located at the bottom, it shows information like current line number, indentation mode, and Git integration status.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
 * Used for Searching and execute various VS Code commands (e.g., creating a new file, formatting code).
 * Access it with Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows).

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
 * Used to enhance VS Code's functionality with extensions for specific programming languages, debuggers, linters, and more.
 * To find extensions in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) or browse the VS Code Marketplace.
 * Essential extensions for web development include:
    Language extensions (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
    Linters (e.g., ESLint)

 * Start debugging with the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D).
 * Proofread through code line by line, inspect variables, and identify errors.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
* Initialize a Git repository in your project folder using the integrated Git commands.
 * Make changes to your code, stage them for commit, and add a commit message.
 * Push your commits to a remote repository like GitHub.
